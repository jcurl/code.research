# Research Code

This repository contains very simple code snippets for my own research. It's not
intended for any specific use.

You'll likely need to initialise submodules (and will need an Internet
connection for GitHub):

```sh
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

- [Benchmarks and Tools for Linux and QNX](./qnx/README.md)
- Research Code
