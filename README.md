# Research Code

This repository contains very simple code snippets for my own research. It's not
intended for any specific use.

You'll need to initialise submodules (and will need an Internet connection for
GitHub for the submodules):

```sh
git submodule update --init
```

See:

- [Benchmarks and Tools for Linux, QNX and BSD](./qnx/README.md)
- Research Code
  - [RCU for C++17](./rcu/README.md)
