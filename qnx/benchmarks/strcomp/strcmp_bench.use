strcmp_bench - compare performance of different string routines

Which method of string comparison is faster for a C++ program? This checks:
- str.substr(0, token_len)
- str.compare(0, token_len, substr)
- str.find_first_of(substr, 0)

Is it faster to check the length explicitly in case 'str' is shorter than
'substr'? What the difference if the string is found or not?

Use these results to estimate the fastest method based on the heuristics of what
kind of match is expected.
