dev-adder - software driver to add one to a uint32_t

dev-adder -n <threads> -i <start>

Options:
 -n  Number of devices to create in /dev/adder/X
 -i  The first number for X.

This is a simple resource manager intended for performance measurements. It
allows a client to open, and send a DCMD_DRIVER_ADD that increments the value
given by 1.

It creates one thread per device, which has its own channel, for multithreaded
processing, where each device operates as a single thread.
